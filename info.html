  <p>Hi, my name is Jeremy Thomas.<br>
  I'm a Front-End Developer from Bordeaux, France.</p>
  <p>I quit my job in summer 2011 but remain connected to the web world and occasionally write about it.</p>
  <p>You're currently browsing the 6th version of this website.<br>
  It's powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, hosted on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">GitHub</a>, and always subject to radical changes.</p>
  <p>All source code, for this version as well as for the previous ones, is available on my <a href="https://github.com/jgthms/jgthms.github.io">jgthms.github.io</a> repository.</p>
