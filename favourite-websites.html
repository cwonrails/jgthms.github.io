        When in 2007, during an web accessibility course, the teacher explained how clean semantic HTML allowed screen readers to perform better, he displayed a small website where hundreds of webpages would only differ in the CSS file used but still provide a different experience each time. In an instant, he inadvertly defined my career for the next decade. More than a proof of concept, CSS Zen Garden simplicity impact on the a path to enlightment.

        The transition from paper to digital has been (and still remains) a constant challenge that traditional newspapers have to face. While the details of developing a sustainable business model are still to be determined, providing a decent online experience is a domain where most (if not all) news websites fail. The Guardian stands above the crowd by embracing the web as a platform, where high density of information and contrasted hierarchy cohabit in peace. That, and clickable titles (so obvious!).

        At its core, this <em>is</em> an ecommerce website: browsing for products, comparing features, making a decision, finalising your checkout. But Apple understood better than anyone before the importance of <em>high quality</em> content, especially pictures. By driving upwards the aesthetics expectations and perfecting the fluidity of interactions, Apple constantly redefines the shopping experience, where the user can't help but think <em>"I don't need to buy this, but I definitely want to"</em>.

        It's easy to make any kind of data available online. It's difficult to keep it easy to navigate. Or is it? How come such a large dataset as the <em>entire</em> movie industry information is so pleasant to use? IMDb is a website. Just use the web's core feature: links. Blue ones, purple ones, where every node of is an entry point to other ones and where simple means easy.

        User generated content is older than the web. Q&amp;A sites aren't that much younger. How can you launch after everyone else and be the top result in 10% of (my) Google searches? Stack Overflow's biggest trick was to not to encourage people to share their knowledge (they were already doing it) but to centralise it in a single location. The virtuous circle of "where to ask/where to answer" had begun. And you realise that creating content was all about organizing it.

        Wikipedia simply embodies what every website is meant for, when you stop <em>looking</em> at the page and start <em>using</em> it for what you initially came for: the content.
