title: Why I'm still uncomfortable using my iMac

I bought my first Mac two years ago: a brand new (and relatively expensive) 27 inch iMac. The main reason behind my purchase was my wish to turn it into my primary music production setup. I intensively use Ableton Live (for recording and writing) and Logic Pro (for mixing). Since then, my iMac has proved to be a very reliable and fast computer for my musical needs. Mac OS' UI and core features are very pleasant as well: Spotlight, Finder's column view, Time Machine backups, keyboard controls, screen captures... Apple's own software is also of great use: iTunes works *way* better than Windows' counterpart, iMovie is incredibly easy to handle, and iPhoto has proved very useful. My iMac has also become my programming computer considering how easy it is to install Python, Ruby, Rails, Node.js, Git...

As a result, I've been inclined to turn my iMac into my *sole* workstation, the one I'd turn to for *any* computer-related task, no matter how casual or insignificant: browsing the web, checking my mail, watching videos, designing websites, playing games... But I still naturally settle for my older 2-screen Windows 7 desktop computer. I wondered why, and came up with the following reasons:



** The iMac mouse

Simply put, the Magic Mouse, is *different*. It's Apple's attempt to improve, or at least disrupt, one of the most basic interface device. The thing is, there *is* a learning curve, which is unusual for an invention that has only been slightly altered for the last 30 years. I wanted to stick to the Magic Mouse considering its interesting interactions with Mac OS, like the multi-touch gestures it provides.



i like scrolling but i think the mouse loves it too much
scrolling when wanting to click
or just scrolling: photoshop zooms out

I *need* that secondary click. Even Apple's own apps like Finder need it.

Why not buying another mouse? I could have, and it would have provided a true right-click, a real scrolling wheel, and even a third-click. But still, it wouldn't have solved the biggest

So, I stick to the Magic Mouse because it's connected to a [habit field](http://alistapart.com/article/habit-fields): the moment I touch a Magic Mouse, I instinctively *know* that the acceleration curve will be different, and my hand subconciously tells my brain to adapt to this new context. This provides me the ability to easily switch back and forth between my iMac and my Windows desktop without any reconfiguration time.



** Keyboard shorcuts and discoverability

You need to considerably bend your fingers to reach the Alt and Control keys, ending up pressing them with your nails instead of your skin, resulting in a 

Mac: key combinations
Windows: key sequences



** Window management

I've been accustomed to using 2 monitors, at work and at home. Firefox or Chrome on the left, Sublime Text on the right, and Photoshop across both sides (canvas on the left, some tools on the right). I don't have a 2nd monitor for my iMac. I could set up one, but:

* I lack the space to
* I would need an equally or closely sized monitor to maintain a certain balance

Although the Mac OS interface is single-task oriented, the screen real estate isn't. Apart from Photoshop or Ableton Live, you don't launch apps in fullscreen on a 27 inch monitor. Text-oriented apps such as a web browser or a text editor can not be efficiently used when a single line of text contains *hundreds* of characters.

So you end up resizing your windows half the width of the monitor. And this in turn, creates another issue: windows keep randomly stacking up across the viewport. I'm unable to find a decent position for them, probably because the positions and dimensions are up to you, and thus their number incredibly large.

I've tried using Spaces but I couldn't get accustomed to it. I need my windows to exist within my view area, and not have theme figuratively disappear beyond the scope of my monitor. Besides, I hate the movement Spaces triggers when switching back and forth between apps that aren't in the same Space.

Although I've tried some window management utilities, I couldn't find one that suited me well. Maybe [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580) that I discovered recently will do the work, considering it replicates Win 7's Aero Snap (and even seems to improve it).

** Too smooth



Weirdly, I have trouble using my iMac, but I don't using my MacBook Air. It probably resides in the fact that:

* a laptop has no mouse
* its single and small screen is more suited for single tasks
* I can launch my apps in fullscreen

Opening my MBA creates a habit field limited environment for better oriented work.





especially with a mouse that I'm not comfortable with.
