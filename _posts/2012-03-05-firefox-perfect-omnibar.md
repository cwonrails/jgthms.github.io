Google Chrome has spread the concept of the Omnibar: merging a browser's URL bar with the search bar. Type anything, and it'll access one of these 5 sources:

* Search Engine
* Bookmarks
* History
* Apps
* Related sites

firefox prediction
key words separated by spaces

* 'local' + project name
* blog name + 'admin'
* 'tw' + username
* 'ny' + 'lis'
* 'iph' + 'desi' = all bookmarks tagged 'iphone' and 'design'

access to history and bookmarks (and bookmark tags)

what about search engines?
search bar, just a close shortcut away (Ctrl + K instead of Ctrl + L)
But Location Bar already works as a search engine: 
Plus: add different engines and trigger each of them with a keyword (or a key letter: 'g' for Google, 'w' for Wikipedia, 'a' for Amazon, 't' for Twitter, 'd' for Dictionary...).

difference: the 'down' key.
Firefox: if you don't, you'll always trigger the default search engine.
