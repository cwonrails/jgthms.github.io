I guess it's a common thing among designers to provide a so-called "unsolicited redesign" of a well-known website and write about it. Here's my humble attempt.

As you would have figured, it's just a screenshot. I didn't change anything because *there is nothing to change*. Or at least, not enough to prompt a complete graphical overhaul.

## "It's about content, stupid!"

Wikipedia is probably my favorite website. I like to imagine it as the epitome of Sir Tim Berners-Lee's vision when he created the Web: a collaborative tool to gather and share knowledge freely.

An open encyclopedia? Accessible online for free? But most importantly, editable by anyone? *"That's crazy, it's never gonna work."* The ability to easily insert false information embodies the usual criticism you would encounter, but actually acts like a fraudulent proof-of-concept of Wikipedia's doomed premise. The thing is, there is in the long run no incentive to alter Wikipedia's content and degrade its integrity. The collaborative authority will prevent it anyway.

As a result, Wikipedia's main, and sole, purpose is to **deliver content**. It's a database of information, 95% of which is text, the not coincidentally "T" in HTML. 

## The "fairy tale" mockup

You've seen it in all redesigns already:

* the Facebook news feed with gorgeous friends pictures
* the ad-less IMDB
* the huge screen/no border iPhone concept
* the huge but nano-weighted font for Reddit
* the image-heavy "2560x1440 optimized" airline website

Sure, let's drop the substance, or alter it enough to fit our needs. It works for me, in my context, on my screen, it's perfect.

This Wikipedia homepage should have tons of pictures, even from irrelevant articles or looking generic, as long as they appeal to the/my eye. http://cdn.gkvasnikov.com/img/design-1.jpg

TL;DR of the links it references.

That's not designing. That's cheating. It's
