<p>Microsoft.com is not a website</p>

<p>The new <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx'>Microsoft.com</a> is a success. There has been much praise about its responsiveness, its simplicity and its clarity. Well-deserved praise I must say, as the design led by Trent Walton&#8217;s agency <a href='http://paravelinc.com/'>Paravel</a> is very well-thought.</p>

<p>Problem is: it&#8217;s not a website. It&#8217;s a portal.</p>

<p>Considering it&#8217;s a single page (and I&#8217;ve done a <a href='http://www.cambodiavietnam2010.com/'>couple</a> <a href='http://reachthethrone.com/'>myself</a>), I can hardly call it a website. Wikipedia itself calls a website a <em>set of related web</em><em>pages</em><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Definitions aside, I have yet to find a link on MS.com that ends up on a page using the <em>same</em> layout. I&#8217;ve tried the navigation menu, the big slides, the footer links&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t able to stay on the same website (which would have turned it in one actually).</p>

<p>Clearly, the role of a navigation menu is to provide <strong>hierarchy</strong>, offering a snapshot of the sitemap, but most of all act as a <strong>guide</strong> to refer to throughout <em>our</em> navigation. What&#8217;s the point in providing a menu when actually using it makes it suddenly disappear?</p>

<p>Here are the 2 options:</p>

<ul>
<li>build a full-scale Microsoft website that is consistent throughout its products</li>

<li>make Microsoft.com look like what it really is: a portal</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the latter is <em>not</em> recommended, considering how portals are outdated and not user-friendly, and considering the great design MS can now work with as a solid base. So, I&#8217;ll wait for a complete rebuild of their website(s). And I secretly hope it&#8217;s already in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The Microsoft.com redesign currently looks like a great step forward, but it&#8217;s not as long as it remains half-baked as it is. And providing a &#8216;Feedback&#8217; button may be a hint of what not to do.</p>
