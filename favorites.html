      <h2>Pinball - Revenge of the Gator</h2>
      <h3>1989 - HAL Labs</h3>
      <p>
        Kicking off this top 10 with a <strong>pinball</strong> game is not innocent. But when you consider the Game Boy's purpose of being able to transcribe into a handheld device a piece of gaming hardware you can actually physically relate to, it encompasses the Game Boy's ability to say: <em>"Those games you played before in real life? Yeah, we got that covered too"</em>.

        Franchises have quickly the popularity of video games, for bad or for worse. Even if it's already available on the NES or the MegaDrive (and the player already bought it), being able to play your hero <em>anywhere</em> is a non-negligeable feature. And if the game correctly conveys the atmosphere, the music, and is supported by a recent Hollywood depiction (from which the story and decors are based on). Challenging and various weapons.

      <p>
        The shoot-em up genre colorful and busy graphics hard to transfer onto a green and yellow screen. But considering arcade games often have only a few basic controls, you could transfer the experience of a big arcade device onto a small handheld one you could carry (and play on) everywhere.

      <h2>Micro Machines</h2>
      <h3>1995 - Mindscape Inc.</h3>
      <p>
        Lacking 3D graphics and the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_7">Mode 7</a> of its big brother the Super NES, the Game Boy didn't seem suited for any <em>decent</em> racing game. It nevertheless carried interesting games (like F1-Race and the isometric Super R.C. Pro-Am).
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember being by Micro Machine's box, which depicted cards and a pool table. I was surprised to find out it was actually a <em>racing</em> game, and the best the Game Boy could offer. Despite its quirky environment and rudimentary controls, Micro Machines was about driving where you had to master the fun but realistic enough physics, and practice incessantly to learn the level design it provided.

      <h2>Super Mario Land</h2>
      <h3>1989 - Nintendo</h3>
      <p>
        Nintendo could not launch a new console (especially a new <em>kind</em> of console) without its flagship character. But how could the Game Boy hold a Mario game less than a year after the incredible 3rd iteration of its NES counterpart (Super Mario Bros. 3)?
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of gameplay and style, Super Mario Land is actually way more closer to the 1985 Super Mario Bros. It had a few inconveniences: inability to walk back, quirkiness
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it still was an incredible platforming game with precise physics, lovely music, and the whole Mario armada of monsters and power-ups. The ability to experience the Mario series within the palm of your hands made up for this seemingly outdated port.

      <h2>Top Ranking Tennis</h2>
      <h3>1993 - Pax Softonica</h3>
      <p>
        How could a <strong>tennis</strong> game (and not even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iax0P3iIXYA">Nintendo's own proposition</a>) make its way to my Game Boy top 5?
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered this gem very much randomly in the Netherlands (although I lived in France), which made my friends take turns to play it, considering both its rarity and its incredible gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tennis games usually require <em>many</em> controls to account for the <strong>versatility</strong> of the sport. Pax Softonica made up for the seemingly limited Game Boy interface buy using both the Start and Select buttons as 2 additional ways to hit the ball (slice and lob respectively).
      </p>
      <p>
        One word: control. Many parameters came into play to define the <em>location</em> and <em>power</em> of a shot: the type (top spin, flat, slice or lob), the timing, the player's position on the court, and the direction (up/down, left/right). These 4 parameters allowed a wide <em>range</em> of shots that I haven't encountered in <em>any</em> tennis game ever since. It was hence easy (and realistic) to trigger a fault (by hitting the net or sending your ball out of bounds).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have played my share of tennis games on many platforms throughout the years (Virtua Tennis, Top Spin, Jimmy Connors, Mario Tennis), but none of them came close to the

      <h2>Kirby's Dream Land</h2>
      <h3>1992 - HAL Labs</h3>
      <p>
        Many only know <strong>Kirby</strong> through Smash Bros.' plethora of characters, probably because its popularity is nowadays solely confined in Japan. But the whole series were kicked off through a short 5-level game in 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing the Game Boy as the device to kick off a new character is an odd choice, especially since the platforming genre was already well established (Mario, Wario, Donkey Kong, Mega Man, the Disney ports...). But a recognizable character, and incredible graphics managed to integrate Kirby in the Nintendo legacy.

      <h3>1989 - Bullet Proof Software</h3>
      <p>
        Although <strong>Tetris</strong> already existed for 5 years when the Game Boy port was launched in 1989, it was this handheld version that actually established the popularity of the franchise and eventually cemented in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tetris is actually the first video game I ever played. It was sold in a bundle with the Game Boy.

        To encompass the legacy of this version <strong>Tetris</strong>, you have to realizeis not only a <em>game</em> but a whole <em>genre</em>.

      <h2>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</h2>
      <h3>1992 - Nintendo</h3>
      <p>
        In 1989, we settled for a decent but rather limited Super Mario Land. We didn't care: we could try to beat Tatanga and save Daisy while driving back from school, probably thinking <em>"I'll just play SMB 3 when I get home"</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's easy to describe how this 2nd opus carries enhanced graphics, more detailed. But the improvements were not limited to one aspect are in the gameplay. Intricate level design, with hidden features and secret exits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to replay levels, navigating through your map, choose your own path, crouching even when small, and save your game when turning off your Game Boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering all the features that managed to make their way onto a portable device, Super Mario Land 2 made the Game Boy become a self-sufficient console.

      <h2>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</h2>
      <h3>1998 - Factor 5</h3>
      <p>
        The European Nintendo 64 launch line-up already included a Star Wars game: <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Shadows_of_the_Empire">Shadows of the Empire</a>, an odd and mediocre collection of unequal gameplays which solely capitalized on the console novelty. It left the franchise fans longing for a better experience, which came around 2 years later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is an <em>exclusively</em> <strong>flight combat</strong> game. (This specificity was probably inspired by its predecessor's best asset, the <em>Battle of Hoth</em> level). It was the first game to offer a 640x480 resolution through the N64's expansion pack.
      </p>
      <p>
        But aside from its technical performance and solid gameplay, Rogue Squadron provided what most fans are looking for: live the Star Wars universe by proxy.
